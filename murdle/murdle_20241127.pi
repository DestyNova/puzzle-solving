  % Weapons
  % AN ALUMINUM PIPE Why do people always bring weapons? Logico could imagine someone getting bashed & beaten with something like this. MEDIUM-WEIGHT • MADE OF METAL
  % A RARE VASE An interesting weapon. Logico has seen people bashed with something like this. For evidence of this, look for a shard of ceramic left behind. HEAVY-WEIGHT • MADE OF CERAMIC
  % A JAR OF ASHES A fascinating weapon. Logico could imagine someone getting bashed & beaten with something like this. It can be identified by some black ash left behind. MEDIUM-WEIGHT • MADE OF METAL & HUMAN REMAINS

  % THE GROUNDS Vast and well-kempt with an enormous statue of an Academy Award in the middle. OUTDOORS
